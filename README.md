## 📊 Project Overview

This application predicts the expected resale value of a car using historical vehicle data. Users provide information such as:

* Present Price
* Kilometers Driven
* Fuel Type
* Seller Type
* Transmission Type
* Number of Previous Owners
* Vehicle Age

The trained machine learning model processes these inputs and generates an estimated selling price instantly.
